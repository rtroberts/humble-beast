As an exercise I’d use my last name to remind me of this unrelenting command that Jesus Christ stated in the book of Matthew. Shortly after, I met a crew of devout believers that were so passionate about radical giving and the story of the ultimate Gift (that is, the Gospel of Jesus Christ) that my life and growing years as a young adult would be forever impacted spiritually and artistically.</p><p>In the Spring of 2014 I was radically gifted the opportunity to partner with Humble Beast Records and what an experience that has been. I was immediately booked for a robust tour schedule with my mentors and new label-mates Propaganda and DJ Efechto. I can effortlessly reflect on the intimate discipleship,&#160;love, support, time, resources, money, sweat, tears, pain, storms, trials, and victories that these two have submitted themselves to for the sake of others. But what proved to be even more remarkable is this<br />character type would immediately prove itself through the whole hive of new lifetime friends/colleagues:&#160;Thomas Terry, Bryan Winchester, Courtland Urbano, Daniel Steele, Jackie Hill-Perry, Gary Bagby, Eshon Burgundy, Esteban Shedd, Aaron Lopez, Lee Green, Hassan Muhammed, Anthony Benedetto, Paul Barger, Rene Garzona, James Calkins, Josh Hill, Adam Crouch, and deliberately listed lastly, Phil Bouleh.</p><p>As a developing artist and a young man, the leadership and guidance in the Christ-like pursuit of excellence in art, evangelism, and theology were moreover what any single, early-twenties, unemployed,&#160;rap novice needs desperately in developing in character and career. I cannot begin to tell of the amount of grace given and intensity of the burdens that Thomas and Bryan have shared to accomplish such a task, and may God always shine his favor on these two men in a special way.</p><p>In the Summer of 2015, we were blessed to present the fruits of our labor as a collaborative partnership in my debut LP entitled Fly Exam, a creative experience that can neither be rivaled, nor reimagined as anything but an example of supernatural tenacity, patience, and overflowing grace and love amongst friends, creatives, and moreover, family—a family that has sacrificed and invested in my potential and my career as a musician.</p><p>Even now, in this reflection, I have been reluctant to the idea of crafting my statement of departure. With the blessing of my partners, I have decided to part ways and end my season with Humble Beast as a contracted recording artist. After much prayer and counsel, and months of deliberation, I’ve decided that what is best for the furthering of my career is to discontinue the pursuit of my contract with the label and pursue other ventures that have been in the works for me. I’ve been exploring a plethora of options for myself and I would not want any of these personal endeavors to clash with any of efforts that Humble Beast has for the future.</p><p>I send my deepest thanks to you and ask that you join me with a continued support of Humble Beast and all its endeavors. It is because of your radical generosity that I have been blessed with the true meaning of freely given.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Jeremiah Givens</p>"}, :enclosures (), :link "http://www.humblebeast.com/news/2016/7/18/a-letter-from-jgivens", :published-date #inst "2016-07-18T20:59:33.000-00:00", :title "A Letter from JGivens", :updated-date nil, :url nil, :uri "5414bfaae4b07dfbf322b0ff:54165d79e4b0a3a5577a7297:578d3dda579fb360accaeb76"} #feedparser_clj.core.entry{:authors (), :categories (), :contents (), :contributors (), :description #feedparser_clj.core.content{:type "text/html", :value "<p>Sho Baraka + Humble Beast<br /><br />Sho has always been a friend of Humble Beast &#38; our ministry.

The Lord really used Christian Hip Hop, specifically Humble Beast and Lamp Mode, to keep my feet on the ground, head in the clouds – especially when I had just thrown out all the sinful garbage I had been listening to before and felt very vulnerable to outside influences and the influence of music being the most prominent.</p><p>I remember hearing my first Christian hip hop song and thinking whoa…</p><p>It had a lot to do with my craving for theology and wanting to really grow in knowledge. At that time in my life I was pining for something that would not only feed me heavier doses of theology but still allow me to sink into the melodic drifts of the music. The latter was just as important to me as the theology – a way of engaging the mind and heart to greater worship.&#160; And that’s where Humble Beast came in. I was getting sound theology but still getting crafted music that I could let take me on the journey of music because I knew it was worship to the King and for that my soul and mind were well pleased at the influence.</p><p>I guess that was a really long way of saying that I’m thankful for Humble Beast Records.</p><p>I’m rather obsessed with the dynamic duo of Film + Music (and by music, I mean more soundtrack than score) and it’s actually why a lot of my favorite films are various music videos or films where music plays a huge narrative role.&#160;I wanted to intern for you guys to see what we could grind out together, utilizing film and music and to see anyway that I can help get your message out which is the message for all time. Whether it’s a Left Roasters' spot or a music video, I know we will do it all unto the Lord and that it’s all ultimately to display our awesome God - so let’s roll!\"</p><h3><br />What is your favorite HB album?</h3><p>\"Hmm... I think I would have to say <em>Instruments of Mercy</em>. JGivens' <em>Fly Exam</em>&#160;is a very close second.\"</p><h3><br />What is your favorite album, period?</h3><p>\"I think it might be Josh Garrels’ newest album,&#160;<em>Home</em>. That album moved me immensely. Talk about an album that carries you to heaven’s shore.\"</p><h3><br />Who is your biggest artistic inspiration?</h3><p>\"I would say C.S. Lewis, the 'Master Likener.'&#160;John Piper, in speaking about Lewis, summarizes my core beliefs, purpose and projection as a filmmaker:</p><blockquote>'…He found from romanticism and rationalism that this world is most honest and most true when it is pointing beyond itself, and thus seeing itself as like that and not that….If the key to the deepest meaning of this world lies outside in what this world is not, then the world will probably be illumined most deeply not simply by describing the world as what it is, but by likening the world to what it is not.'</blockquote><p>I would also add St. Augustine. The weight and rawness this man brings inspires me on almost everything I do. I don’t think there has been a project where I’m not musing on C.S. Lewis and St. Augustine.\"<br /> </p><h3>Tell us two or three movies whose cinematography has impressed you.</h3><p>\"I would like to very seriously put a disclaimer on this answer. While there is certainly a massive influence from these films on my life as a filmmaker, I’m not sure if I would return to some of these films, or recommend them.&#160;It always bums me out when you go back to one of your favorite films and find all this sinful garbage in it! At that point you gotta just trash it. Nonetheless, here are some films whose cinematography very much influenced and impressed me:&#160;<em>Apocalypse Now</em>,&#160;<em>Rhinoceros</em>,&#160;Daft Punk’s <em>Electroma</em>. More recently, I loved the cinematography of <em>Selma</em>.\"</p><h3><br />Is Leo finally going to win that Oscar for his role in the Revenant?</h3><p>\"Haha! Well, I hope so. While I haven’t seen the <em>Revenant</em> yet, I typically love all Leo’s work, and I do believe he deserves an Oscar. I also bet that the cinematography is going to be breathtaking when I finally see it.\"</p><p>(Editor's Note: Since answering these questions, Ashton has seen the movie.
